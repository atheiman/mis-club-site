# MIS Club Site

Created by Austin Heiman for the K-State MIS Club.

## What is Django?

The MIS Club Attendance web application is a Django powered site. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a full-featured, mature, open-source, and actively developed Python web framework with several components:

- **Object Relational Mapper** - Allows developers to establish a link between Python objects and records in a database.
- **Views and URL Resolving** - Allows developers to map attractive, meaningful urls (`example.com/login` and `example.com/users/atheiman` rather than `example.com/Login.event?token=1n1u23ibsdf0&id=adf8b%89%78%23ajsn`) to data-driven views.
- **Forms** - Allows developers to quickly create **secure** forms from models.
- **Templating** - Allows developers to create [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) web pages using template inheritance and easy to read template logic.
- **Administration Site** - Django projects include an automatically generated administration site that allows a staff to easily manage their data via a functional web interface.

> Some well-known sites that use Django include Pinterest, Instagram, Mozilla, The Washington Times, Disqus, the Public Broadcasting Service, and Bitbucket.

Our site, like most Django sites, runs on a Virtual Private Server in *the cloud*. It utilizes several popular technologies:

- DigitalOcean
